Note: Always prefer NuGet for dependency management. 

This folder should only be used for:
- Sitecore hotfixes / patches - create a folder for each patch and include a readme.txt file outlining the details of the patch and referencing the JIRA ticket
- 3rd party components that are not available as NuGet packages
