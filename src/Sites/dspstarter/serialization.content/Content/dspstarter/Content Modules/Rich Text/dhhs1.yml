        In collaboration with the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Deloitte Digital transformed three flagship health websites - Better Health Channel, Health.vic.gov.au and Seniors Online using the Sitecore Experience Platform.<br>
        <div><strong><br>
        A modern digital channel platform</strong></div>
        <div>The Department’s websites were based on legacy technologies and on multiple Content Management Systems which made it hard for users to navigate. Management of the content was also cumbersome and personalisation of the user experience was not possible.</div>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.875;"> </span></div>
        <div><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.875;">Deloitte worked closely with the Department to fully redevelop all three websites, making them consistent, enhancing the customer experience and ensuring that they were fully responsive for both mobile and tablet devices using a mobile-first UX design philosophy.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.875;">Deloitte accelerated the delivery of the sites by developing a shared framework of content management components. This approach has subsequently been used as the basis for fast-to-market delivery of additional sites on the same platform.<br><br></span><b style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.875;">The challenge of information at scale<br></b><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.875;">Given the large amount of content housed by the websites, discovery and maintenance of content were key challenges that needed to be addressed. Categorisation of content using tagging was used to allow for automated cross-linking of related information and also assisted in flattening the information architecture by enabling interaction with and discovery of content using search.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.875;">This approach facilitated the Department’s desired “no wrong door” content discovery approach and reduced the overhead on content authors to manually maintain linkages between content. It also drives distribution of information through a content digest capability integrated into the platform.<br><br></span><b style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.875;">Playful, yet trustworthy experience<br></b><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.875;">Deloitte balanced a bright, playful design suitable for all age demographics with features which surfaced information right when you wanted it in a format that is easily consumed and interacted with on your device of choice.</span></div>
