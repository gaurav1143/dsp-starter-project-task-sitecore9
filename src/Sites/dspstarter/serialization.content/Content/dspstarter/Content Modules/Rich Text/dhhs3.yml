      Value: "<div><b>The challenge of information at scale</b></div><div>Given the large amount of content housed by the websites, discovery and maintenance of content were key challenges that needed to be addressed. Categorisation of content using tagging was used to allow for automated cross-linking of related information and also assisted in flattening the information architecture by enabling interaction with and discovery of content using search.</div><div><br>This approach facilitated the Department’s desired “no wrong door” content discovery approach and reduced the overhead on content authors to manually maintain linkages between content. It also drives distribution of information through a content digest capability integrated into the platform.</div>"
