For 110 years RAC has recognised the importance of delivering new and improved services, and continues to focus on its digital channels to drive future success.</p>
        <p style="color: #555555; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">In partnership with Deloitte Digital, RAC has recently launched myRAC, the first release of a new portal for its members. The new portal makes it easy for members to engage with RAC and view their existing services, membership benefits, payment details and manage their insurance policies through a personalised member experience. The portal has been developed using Sitecore&rsquo;s flagship product &ndash; Sitecore Experience Platform (SEP), which has been recognised as a global leader in Customer Experience Management.</p>
        <p style="color: #555555; margin: 0px 0px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">Michael Scott, Deloitte Digital partner said: &ldquo;The launch of myRAC is an important milestone in realising RAC&rsquo;s digital strategy. For the first time members are presented a personalised, consolidated view of their relationship with RAC that also makes it easier to engage online, and on any device. RAC&rsquo;s investment in the Sitecore&rsquo;s Experience Platform means it can build on this first release to take advantage of the personalisation, marketing automation, analytics and web content management capabilities that Sitecore provides.&rdquo;</p>
