        <p><strong>Modern army website combats the closed-off stereotype<br>
        </strong>The Australian Army performs a vital role in today’s world with a deep commitment to the security of Australia in the 21st century. To match today’s modern Army, a new website was launched on the Army’s 111th birthday celebrations.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>The mystery of military agencies<br>
        </strong>The Australian Army faces the same challenge as other military agencies around the world: communicating with the country’s constituents, current members and veterans. To break down this closed–off stereotype and remove the sense of mystery, the Army wanted to build the profile of the service they provide and share the breadth of work they do.</p>
        <p><strong>The army shares its story<br>
        </strong>People are the Army’s most valuable asset. That’s why the new website focusses on sharing their stories.Engaging design invites users to discover more about the Army, social features enable users to share the work Army does, and smart website elements change based on user behaviour.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>A more informed Australia<br>
        </strong>The new website, with its modern CMS, acts as a centralised point for multiple departments and media communications. Improved usability and content has led to an increase in traffic and resulted in a more informed Australian public and engaged Army families.</p>
