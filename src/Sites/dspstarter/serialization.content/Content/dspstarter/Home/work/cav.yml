        <p><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Consumer Affairs are Victoria&rsquo;s consumer affairs regulator. Their purpose is to help Victorians be responsible and informed businesses and consumers.</span></p>
        <p><strong>Website no longer supporting the needs of users<br>
        </strong></p>
        <p>Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV) is a Government organisation that protects and promotes the interests of Victorian consumers and businesses.<br>
        <br>
        The existing CAV website originally intended as a temporary website had been in operation since 2004.&nbsp;Changing user expectations, new programs and organisational priorities meant that this website was longer able to support the services that the organisation wanted to deliver.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>New interface design and mobile concepts<br>
        </strong></p>
        <p>The initial engagement with CAV focused on the identification and documentation of business and functional requirements. A detailed web design was created for the new website, along with functional and technical specifications, and a content migration framework.<br>
        <br>
        A new AA compliant website was subsequently implemented using the Sitecore CMS platform. The implementation was managed as a two phased approach initially delivering core website functionality, followed by advanced features two months later.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>A consolidated view of related information<br>
        </strong></p>
        <p>With a new, more efficient Information Architecture, the site has become easier to navigate, helping users locate information on their rights and responsibilities and the services CAV provides.The new website design includes aggregation of content published in social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, thereby providing website visitors a consolidated view of related information.</p>
