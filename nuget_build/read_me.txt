	Nuget Package Creation
------------------------------------------

To generate a Nuget Pacakge based off the existing packages within this folder, run the 'cmd' file of the project you wish to generate the package for (e.g DSP.Site.Dspstarter.0.0.2).

Once completed, you can view the packages contents by opening it using Nuget Package Explorer (google to download if you do not have this installed) or by adding extention .zip to filename.

To create your own nuget package based off a new feature, please refer to Deloitte DSP wiki for how to on creating custom DSP.Feature.* nuget package.
